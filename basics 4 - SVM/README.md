## Support Vector Machines on MNIST
The task is to experiment with Support Vector Machines for digit recognition.This experiment is cross-validation based, hence will take sometime to run.

The additional agenda, was to tune hyperparameters. There are a lot of hyperparameters to tune, and model strategies to try. I tried a sequential strategy using cross-validation to prevent brute-force. It can be seen in the report as well as the code.

# Run Instructions
To run the code just type this in the terminal
python script.py

# Data
MNIST Digits data
