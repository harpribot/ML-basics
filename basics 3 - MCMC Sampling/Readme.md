# Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling


## Submission Files

1. Simulation Report.pdf -> I did the Monte-Carlo Simulation on 2 methods:
      A. Gibbs Sampling (2D)
      B. Metropolis Algorithm (1D and 2D)

2. simulation.py -> source code to run the simulation.

3. Sampling Distribution -> Mixture of Gaussians

## run instructions
Do any one of the the two methods:
1. Method 1
python simulation.py

2. Method 2 - Ipython
%run simulation.py
