# ML-Basics
This work comes out of the Machine Learning (CS-391L) class at UT Austin. It was an introductory class. Each assignment highlights an introductory concept in ML. I decided to make a project, which contains all the baseline implementations of Machine Learning, for any beginner to understand and get their hands dirty. All the experiments are nicely explained as Project Report.

# My Basics
1. Principal Component Analysis
2. Independent Component Analysis
3. Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling
4. Support Vector Machines
5. Graphical Inference - In Progress

# Collaboration
I would like to take it a step further. If you have some baseline implementation of a concept, we can collaborate to clean it and put it here for other newcomers to use as a resource for building up their knowledge in Machine Learning. The task is to give them an end to end implementation, so that they can understand not just the algorithm, but also how it works. I am very willing to build up this project, and my aim is to make it the best resource for all starter implementation of ML models.
